# Prediction of future electric vehicle mileage and assessment of required infrastructure.

- Combined a variety of disparate governement-based vehicle & electric vehicle (EV) datasets to predict & visualise the acceleration of annual EV mileage (over the next 30 years) and predicted the likely increase in energy demand as a result. 
- Based on available data, I then recommend the best combination of future energy generation technologies to invest in.
- See "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY.pdf" for an overview of my findings.
- A video presentation of my findings is also avaibe under "video_presentation.mp4".

Here is a figure from my analysis:

This shows my forecast for the number of EVs in the UK over the next 30 years, alongside predictions from the Climate Change Committee (CCC) and my prediction for the total number of all types of vehicles. By 2050, all vehicles are predicted to be electric.
