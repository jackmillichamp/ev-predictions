# Prediction of future electric vehicle mileage and assessment of required infrastructure.

Combine a variety of disparate governement-based vehicle & electric vehicle (EV) datasets to predict & visualise the acceleration of annual EV mileage (over the next 30 years) and predict the likely increase in energy demand as a result. Based on available data, I then recommend the best combination of future energy generation technologies to invest in.
